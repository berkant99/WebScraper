The provided code is a C# program that demonstrates how to scrape data from an HTML file using the HtmlAgilityPack library. The scraped data is then stored in a custom class called Product, and the program converts the scraped data into a JSON array using the Newtonsoft.Json library.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

The code starts by importing the required namespaces: HtmlAgilityPack for HTML parsing and Newtonsoft.Json for JSON serialization.

Inside the Program class, a nested class Product is defined. This class represents the structure of the scraped data and has properties for ProductName, Price, and Rating.

The Main method is the entry point of the program.

The method starts by specifying the file path of the HTML file to be scraped.

The HTML file content is loaded using File.ReadAllText and stored in the html variable.

An instance of HtmlDocument is created and the HTML content is loaded into it using doc.LoadHtml(html).

A list named products is created to store the scraped data.

The program uses CSS selectors to find and extract the desired information from the HTML file. It selects all elements with the class "item" using doc.DocumentNode.QuerySelectorAll(".item"). Inside the loop, specific elements within each item are selected using CSS selectors such as itemNode.QuerySelector("figure img") for the product name, itemNode.QuerySelector(".price-display.formatted span").FirstChild for the price, and itemNode.Attributes["rating"].Value for the rating.

The extracted data is then processed and stored in the Product class. The product name is obtained from the alt attribute of the image element, the price is extracted from the inner text of the selected price node, and the rating is normalized if it is a valid double value.

A new Product object is created and initialized with the extracted data, and then added to the products list.

After the loop, the program serializes the products list into a JSON array using JsonConvert.SerializeObject.

The JSON array is printed to the console using Console.WriteLine.

The code includes error handling for file not found and I/O exceptions.
